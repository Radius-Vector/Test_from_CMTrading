Hello! My name is Dmitriy Sitliviy! 
Here I have uploaded my test. 
I used MS SQL for SQL tasks and Tableau for visualization.

I worked with these programs in my previous company. I created a separate database in MS SQL, and before starting tasks, I explored the data. There were duplicate rows in the "Data Sample Client Accounts" table, but I fixed them.

The solution to the SQL tasks is included [this document](https://github.com/Radius-Vector/Test_from_CMTrading/blob/main/SQL%2C%20Test.txt).

In the first task, I showed all transactions and whether there was information about the agent name or account number. When this information was absent, I showed NULL.

In the third task, I counted the number of certain amounts of deposits and ordered them in descending order.

I thought I should mention these tasks because they seemed ambiguous.

Now, let's take a look at the visual part of my test.

To build the graphics, I used [two views](https://github.com/Radius-Vector/Test_from_CMTrading/blob/main/SQL%2C%20views.txt).

[Here you can download Tableau file and watch dashboard](https://github.com/Radius-Vector/Test_from_CMTrading/raw/main/Test%20by%20Dmitrii%20Sitliviy.twbx).

On the top part of the dashboard, you can see the top 10 agents and their sum of deposits and other metrics. You can view this information for different time periods and regions.

I believe that the agent who brought the company the most money is the best agent.

On the bottom part of the dashboard, there is a graph of the activities of the top 10 clients by net worth.

That's all I wanted to show you! Goodbye!
