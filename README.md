Hello! 
My name is Dmitriy Sitliviy!
Here I have downloaded my test.
I was using MS SQL for SQL tasks and Tableau for visualisation

I was working with these programms in my previous company.

I created separate database in MS SQL and before tasks I explore data.
There was duplicate rows in "Data Sample Client Accounts" table. I had fixed it.

Disicion of SQL task I wrote on [this text document](https://github.com/Radius-Vector/Test_from_CMTrading/blob/main/SQL%2C%20Test.txt).

In first task I showed all transaction and if there was information about agent name or account number. When that information are absent I was show NULL.

In third task I counted the number certain amounts of deposits and ordered by descending.

I thought I would should mention about this tasks, becouse they seemed ambiguous.

Let's see visual part of my test.

For building grafics I was using [two views](  ).

Here you can download Tableau file and watch dashboard.

On top part of dashboard you can see top 10 agents and their sum of deposit and other metrics. You can see this information on different time period and region.

I believe that agent who brought company the most money is the best agent.

On bottom part of dashboard lays graphic of activities of top 10 clients by net worth.

That's all what I want to show you! Good bye!
